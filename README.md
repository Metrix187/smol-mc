Tiny Minecraft-flavored voxel sandbox crammed into a single HTML file like a good boy.  
No build step, no deps, just **4ish KiB of cursed JavaScript**

### What this is

- **First‑person voxel world** with grass, dirt, stone and water.
- **Basic physics**: gravity, jumping, collision.
- **Block editing**: break and place blocks to ruin the terrain however you like :3
- All of this lives inside `index.html`, because apparently we swag like that.

### Controls

- **Move**: `W A S D`
- **Jump**: `Space`
- **Look around**: move the mouse (click once to lock pointer)
- **Reset position**: `R`
- **Select block type**: number keys `1`–`4`
- **Break block**: left click
- **Place block**: right click (can’t place water, sorry bestie)

If your mouse gets stuck, hit `Esc` to exit pointer lock like a responsible gamer.

### How to run it (i'll get a demo up soon maybe)

- Clone / download this repo. (or just copy and paste the code, we don't care~)
- Open `index.html` in a desktop browser (Chrome / Firefox / IE recommended).
- Click on the canvas once to grab the mouse, then go feral.

### File

- **`index.html`** – fully minified, under 4 KiB, what the browser actually can handle.

Tweak `index.html` if you want to mod things, and minify however you like.  
If you manage to squeeze it even smaller without breaking everything, I’m proud of you.
